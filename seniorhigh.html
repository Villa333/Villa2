 <p style="background-color:rgb(200, 200, 200);">I am a senior in high school right now. This semester was the last of my secondary education, and there was a lot for my classmates and me to look forward to: senior field trips, spring break, senior spirit week during our last week of school, senior parade on our last day, prom, and graduation.

At the beginning of the semester, I didn’t even think twice about the possibility for those events to be canceled. Boy was I wrong.

Let’s take a look at how things were mid-February. It was common knowledge that the coronavirus was spreading quite fast around the world, but the United States hadn’t yet reported any cases. Knowing this, I had a small glimpse of hope that the virus would somehow avoid the United States and I wouldn’t have to worry about it. I knew in the back of my mind that this was an unrealistic hope, but there were so many things (as previously mentioned) that I was looking forward to this semester so I was trying to avoid thinking about the possibility of those things not happening.
