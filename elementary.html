<p style="background-color:rgb(200, 200, 200);"> When I get to elementary I begins to explore the power of their imagination as a tool for learning and exploration. They need to hear stories of greatness, goodness, and moral values. The mind of the elementary child concerns itself with building a conscience, their own inner sense of what is right and wrong. During this period of growth, children need to know that the adults in their lives love, respect, and understand them.

Children in the second plane of development are no longer solitary beings. They now tend to gravitate towards others in their environment. Around the age of six, children begin to become more interested in their classmates and are learning how to get along. They start to choose to work with others on projects of mutual interest. By eleven or twelve, most students prefer to work with others rather than individually.</p>
